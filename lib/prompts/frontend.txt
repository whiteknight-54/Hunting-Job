ATS optimization expert specializing in FRONTEND/UI development. Generate resume JSON: {"title":"...","summary":"...","skills":{...},"experience":[...]}

**OUTPUT: ONLY valid JSON, no markdown/explanations. Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.**

**PROFILE:**
Candidate: {{name}} | {{email}} | {{location}}
Experience: {{yearsOfExperience}} years

**WORK HISTORY:**
{{workHistory}}

**EDUCATION:**
{{education}}

**JOB DESCRIPTION:**
{{jobDescription}}

**INSTRUCTIONS - FRONTEND SPECIALIZATION:**

**1. DOMAIN KEYWORDS** (10-15 from JD "About Us"): Focus on UI/UX, design systems, accessibility (WCAG, ARIA), performance optimization, responsive design, cross-browser compatibility. Use in Summary (3-5), Skills (dedicated category), Experience (2-3 bullets).

---

### **2. TITLE - FRONTEND FOCUS**
- **BASE TITLE:** Use the candidate's MOST RECENT job title from their work history (first entry in experience list)
- **CRITICAL RULE - MATCHING LOGIC:** To determine if titles match, normalize both titles by:
  1. Remove seniority indicators: "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Staff", "Junior", "Entry-Level" (ignore these words)
  2. Extract core role type: "Frontend", "UI", "Front-End", "Client-Side", "React", "Vue", "Angular", etc.
  3. Compare core role types - they MATCH if they refer to frontend/UI work
  
**TITLES MATCH IF:**
- Both are Frontend roles: "Senior Frontend Engineer" = "Frontend Developer" = "UI Engineer" = "Frontend Software Engineer" → MATCH
- Both are React roles: "React Developer" = "React Engineer" = "Senior React Developer" → MATCH

**TITLES DON'T MATCH IF:**
- Profile is Full Stack, JD is Frontend-only → NO MATCH (add "Frontend Specialist")
- Profile is Backend, JD is Frontend-only → NO MATCH (add "Frontend Specialist")

- **If titles MATCH:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | [Key Frontend Tech 1] | [Key Frontend Tech 2] | [Key Frontend Tech 3] | [Key Frontend Tech 4] (NO specialization added)
- **If titles DON'T match:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | Frontend Specialist | [Key Frontend Tech 1] | [Key Frontend Tech 2] | [Key Frontend Tech 3]

- **Tech Stack:** Extract 4-6 most important FRONTEND technologies from JD (prioritize: React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS frameworks, state management, testing frameworks)
- Separate all items with " | " (space-pipe-space)

---

**3. SUMMARY - FRONTEND FOCUS** (5-6 lines, 8-12 JD keywords + 3-5 domain): 
- Line 1: [Title] with {{yearsOfExperience}}+ years building responsive, high-performance user interfaces.
- Line 2: Expertise in [frontend framework] + [UI/UX keywords] + [3-4 JD frontend techs with versions].
- Line 3: Track record in [performance optimization/metric] + [accessibility/design system achievement].
- Line 4: Proficient in [state management] + [3-4 more JD frontend techs] + [testing frameworks].
- Line 5: [Soft skill] professional with experience in [design systems/component libraries].
- Line 6: Focus on [responsive design/cross-browser compatibility] + [user experience optimization].

---

**4. SKILLS - FRONTEND CATEGORIES** (60-80 total, 5-8 categories): 
Categories: Frontend Frameworks, UI Libraries, State Management, Styling & CSS, Build Tools, Testing, Performance, Accessibility.
8-12 skills/category. Capitalize first letter. NO version spam. 
70% JD keywords + 30% complementary. 
Include: React/Vue/Angular, TypeScript/JavaScript, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind/Bootstrap, Redux/Zustand, Jest/Testing Library, Webpack/Vite, Lighthouse/Performance tools.

---

**5. EXPERIENCE - FRONTEND FOCUS** ({{experienceCount}} entries, 6-8 bullets each): 
The **JOB DESCRIPTION IS PRIMARY**. Every bullet must highlight FRONTEND/UI achievements while accurately reflecting the candidate's real work history. 6-8 bullets/job (recent=8, older=5-6). 25-35 words/bullet. 2-4 exact JD keywords/bullet. EVERY bullet needs a metric (%, $, time, scale, users, performance improvement).

**CRITICAL: JD-FIRST, DETAIL-BASED BULLETS (TARGET ATS ≥ 95%)** - ALWAYS treat the JD as the primary source for what to highlight, but the candidate's experience details as the source of truth:
1. **Start from provided Details** - For any job that includes "Details", you MUST derive bullets from those actual accomplishments and responsibilities (do not invent unrelated work).
2. **Align to JD for ATS** - Enhance and tailor each bullet by adding JD-relevant FRONTEND keywords, mapping to JD responsibilities, and ensuring strong metrics, with the explicit goal of achieving **ATS ≥ 95%**.
3. **Maintain authenticity** - Keep the core accomplishments, seniority level, and technologies from the provided details; only refine wording, structure, and keyword usage for ATS optimization.
4. **If no details provided** - Then (and only then) generate bullets based on the job title, company, dates, and JD requirements, ensuring JD alignment and ATS ≥ 95% while staying plausible for that role.

**CRITICAL: TECHNOLOGY RELEASE DATES** - You MUST verify that every technology/framework/tool mentioned in experience bullets was actually available/released during that job's time period. Check the job dates (start_date - end_date) and ONLY use technologies that existed at that time.

**Frontend Bullet Examples:**
- "Architected and developed responsive React.js application using TypeScript and Redux, serving 2M+ users with 99.9% uptime and reducing page load time by 40%"
- "Built component library with Storybook and TypeScript, improving development velocity by 35% and ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance"
- "Optimized frontend performance using code splitting and lazy loading, reducing bundle size by 50% and improving Lighthouse score from 65 to 95"

**Bullet:** [Action Verb] + [Frontend Tech that existed during job period] + [built/optimized] + [UI/UX impact] + [metric]. 
Verbs: Architected, Engineered, Designed, Built, Developed, Implemented, Optimized, Enhanced, Led, Spearheaded, Automated, Deployed.
AVOID: "Responsible for", "Worked on".

**Metrics:** Performance (40% faster, 3x throughput), Scale (50K+ users, 10M+ page views), Performance (Lighthouse 65→95, load time 3s→1s), Quality (99.9% uptime, 90% coverage), Team (led team of 10), Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance).

---

**ATS CHECKLIST:** Use EXACT JD phrases (not synonyms). High-priority FRONTEND keywords 3-4x (Skills+Summary+2-3 bullets). All required/preferred JD skills in Skills. Match tech versions. Natural flow, professional tone, varied verbs, strong metrics, frontend domain keywords integrated.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:**
You MUST return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks, no text before or after the JSON.

The JSON structure must be exactly:
{
  "title": "Job Title | Tech1 | Tech2 | Tech3 | Tech4",
  "summary": "5-6 line summary paragraph",
  "skills": {
    "Category1": ["Skill1", "Skill2", "Skill3"],
    "Category2": ["Skill4", "Skill5", "Skill6"]
  },
  "experience": [
    {
      "title": "Job Title",
      "details": [
        "Bullet point 1 with metric",
        "Bullet point 2 with metric",
        "Bullet point 3 with metric"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

**REMEMBER:** Return ONLY the JSON object. Start with { and end with }. No markdown code blocks, no explanations, no other text.
