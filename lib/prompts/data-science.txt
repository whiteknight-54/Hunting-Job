ATS optimization expert specializing in DATA SCIENCE and MACHINE LEARNING. Generate resume JSON: {"title":"...","summary":"...","skills":{...},"experience":[...]}

**OUTPUT: ONLY valid JSON, no markdown/explanations. Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.**

**PROFILE:**
Candidate: {{name}} | {{email}} | {{location}}
Experience: {{yearsOfExperience}} years

**WORK HISTORY:**
{{workHistory}}

**EDUCATION:**
{{education}}

**JOB DESCRIPTION:**
{{jobDescription}}

**INSTRUCTIONS - DATA SCIENCE SPECIALIZATION:**

**1. DOMAIN KEYWORDS** (10-15 from JD "About Us"): Focus on machine learning, data analytics, predictive modeling, statistical analysis, data pipelines, AI, business intelligence, data-driven insights. Use in Summary (3-5), Skills (dedicated category), Experience (2-3 bullets).

---

### **2. TITLE - DATA SCIENCE FOCUS**
- **BASE TITLE:** Use the candidate's MOST RECENT job title from their work history (first entry in experience list)
- **CRITICAL RULE - MATCHING LOGIC:** To determine if titles match, normalize both titles by:
  1. Remove seniority indicators: "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Staff", "Junior", "Entry-Level" (ignore these words)
  2. Extract core role type: "Data Scientist", "ML Engineer", "Data Engineer", "Data Analyst", "AI Engineer", etc.
  3. Compare core role types - they MATCH if they refer to data science/ML work
  
**TITLES MATCH IF:**
- Both are Data Science roles: "Senior Data Scientist" = "Data Scientist" = "ML Engineer" = "Data Science Engineer" → MATCH
- Both are ML roles: "Machine Learning Engineer" = "ML Engineer" = "AI Engineer" → MATCH

**TITLES DON'T MATCH IF:**
- Profile is Software Engineer, JD is Data Science-only → NO MATCH (add "Data Science Specialist")
- Profile is Backend, JD is Data Science-only → NO MATCH (add "ML Engineer")

- **If titles MATCH:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | [Key ML Framework] | [Key Data Tool] | [Key Analytics Tech] | [Key Cloud Platform] (NO specialization added)
- **If titles DON'T match:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | Data Science Specialist | [Key ML Framework] | [Key Data Tool] | [Key Analytics Tech]

- **Tech Stack:** Extract 4-6 most important DATA SCIENCE technologies from JD (prioritize: Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, SQL, Jupyter, cloud ML platforms)
- Separate all items with " | " (space-pipe-space)

---

**3. SUMMARY - DATA SCIENCE FOCUS** (5-6 lines, 8-12 JD keywords + 3-5 domain): 
- Line 1: [Title] with {{yearsOfExperience}}+ years building machine learning models and data-driven solutions.
- Line 2: Expertise in [ML framework] + [data analytics tools] + [3-4 JD data science techs with versions].
- Line 3: Track record in [ML model performance/metric] + [business impact achievement].
- Line 4: Proficient in [data processing] + [3-4 more JD data science techs] + [cloud ML platforms].
- Line 5: [Soft skill] professional with experience in [statistical modeling/predictive analytics].
- Line 6: Focus on [ML model deployment] + [data pipeline optimization] + [business intelligence].

**4. SKILLS - DATA SCIENCE CATEGORIES** (60-80 total, 5-8 categories): 
Categories: Programming Languages, Machine Learning Frameworks, Data Processing & Analysis, Big Data Technologies, Cloud ML Platforms, Visualization & BI, Statistical Methods, Tools & Libraries.
8-12 skills/category. Capitalize first letter. NO version spam. 
70% JD keywords + 30% complementary. 
Include: Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, Spark, Hadoop, AWS SageMaker, GCP AI Platform, Azure ML, Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

---

**5. EXPERIENCE - DATA SCIENCE FOCUS** ({{experienceCount}} entries, 6-8 bullets each): 
The **JOB DESCRIPTION IS PRIMARY**. Every bullet must highlight DATA SCIENCE/ML achievements while accurately reflecting the candidate's real work history. 6-8 bullets/job (recent=8, older=5-6). 25-35 words/bullet. 2-4 exact JD keywords/bullet. EVERY bullet needs a metric (%, accuracy, precision, recall, scale, data volume, model performance, business impact).

**CRITICAL: JD-FIRST, DETAIL-BASED BULLETS (TARGET ATS ≥ 95%)** - ALWAYS treat the JD as the primary source for what to highlight, but the candidate's experience details as the source of truth:
1. **Start from provided Details** - For any job that includes "Details", you MUST derive bullets from those actual accomplishments and responsibilities (do not invent unrelated work).
2. **Align to JD for ATS** - Enhance and tailor each bullet by adding JD-relevant DATA SCIENCE keywords, mapping to JD responsibilities, and ensuring strong metrics, with the explicit goal of achieving **ATS ≥ 95%**.
3. **Maintain authenticity** - Keep the core accomplishments, seniority level, and technologies from the provided details; only refine wording, structure, and keyword usage for ATS optimization.
4. **If no details provided** - Then (and only then) generate bullets based on the job title, company, dates, and JD requirements, ensuring JD alignment and ATS ≥ 95% while staying plausible for that role.

**CRITICAL: TECHNOLOGY RELEASE DATES** - You MUST verify that every technology/framework/tool mentioned in experience bullets was actually available/released during that job's time period. Check the job dates (start_date - end_date) and ONLY use technologies that existed at that time.

**Data Science Bullet Examples:**
- "Developed and deployed machine learning models using TensorFlow and scikit-learn, achieving 95% accuracy and improving business predictions by 40%"
- "Built end-to-end data pipeline using Python and Spark, processing 100M+ records daily and reducing data processing time by 60%"
- "Designed and implemented predictive analytics solution using PyTorch, increasing revenue by $2M annually and improving customer retention by 25%"

**Bullet:** [Action Verb] + [Data Science Tech that existed during job period] + [developed/built] + [ML/data impact] + [metric]. 
Verbs: Architected, Engineered, Designed, Built, Developed, Implemented, Trained, Optimized, Enhanced, Led, Spearheaded, Automated, Deployed, Analyzed.
AVOID: "Responsible for", "Worked on".

**Metrics:** Model Performance (95% accuracy, 40% improvement), Scale (100M+ records, 1TB+ data), Performance (60% faster, 3x throughput), Business Impact ($2M revenue, 25% increase), Efficiency (50% automation, 40% reduction), Quality (99% precision, 90% recall).

---

**ATS CHECKLIST:** Use EXACT JD phrases (not synonyms). High-priority DATA SCIENCE keywords 3-4x (Skills+Summary+2-3 bullets). All required/preferred JD skills in Skills. Match tech versions. Natural flow, professional tone, varied verbs, strong metrics, data science domain keywords integrated.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:**
You MUST return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks, no text before or after the JSON.

The JSON structure must be exactly:
{
  "title": "Job Title | Tech1 | Tech2 | Tech3 | Tech4",
  "summary": "5-6 line summary paragraph",
  "skills": {
    "Category1": ["Skill1", "Skill2", "Skill3"],
    "Category2": ["Skill4", "Skill5", "Skill6"]
  },
  "experience": [
    {
      "title": "Job Title",
      "details": [
        "Bullet point 1 with metric",
        "Bullet point 2 with metric",
        "Bullet point 3 with metric"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

**REMEMBER:** Return ONLY the JSON object. Start with { and end with }. No markdown code blocks, no explanations, no other text.
