{{jobDescription}}

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

**1. DOMAIN KEYWORDS** (10-15 from JD "About Us"): Identity/Security (OAuth2, JWT, SAML, MFA, SSO, SOC 2, GDPR), Payments (PCI-DSS, fraud detection, KYC/AML, tokenization), Healthcare (HIPAA, HL7, FHIR, EHR), Data (data governance, GDPR, PII protection). Use in Summary (3-5), Skills (dedicated category), Experience (2-3 bullets).

### **2. TITLE**
- **BASE TITLE:** Use the candidate's MOST RECENT job title from their work history (first entry in experience list)
- **CRITICAL RULE - MATCHING LOGIC:** To determine if titles match, normalize both titles by:
  1. Remove seniority indicators: "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Staff", "Junior", "Entry-Level" (ignore these words)
  2. Extract core role type: "Full Stack", "Frontend", "Backend", "Software Engineer", "Developer", "Engineer", "Architect", "DevOps", "QA", etc.
  3. Compare core role types - they MATCH if they refer to the same domain/type, even if wording differs slightly
  
**TITLES MATCH IF:**
- Both are Full Stack roles: "Senior Full Stack Engineer" = "Full Stack Developer" = "Full Stack Software Engineer" = "Full Stack Engineer" → MATCH
- Both are Frontend roles: "Senior Frontend Engineer" = "Frontend Developer" = "Frontend Software Engineer" → MATCH
- Both are Backend roles: "Senior Backend Engineer" = "Backend Developer" = "Backend Software Engineer" → MATCH
- Both are Software Engineer/Developer (general): "Senior Software Engineer" = "Software Developer" = "Senior Developer" → MATCH
- Both are DevOps roles: "Senior DevOps Engineer" = "DevOps Engineer" = "DevOps Specialist" → MATCH

**TITLES DON'T MATCH IF:**
- Profile is Full Stack, JD is Frontend-only → NO MATCH (add "Frontend Specialist")
- Profile is Frontend, JD is Backend-only → NO MATCH (add "Backend Specialist")
- Profile is Backend, JD is Full Stack → NO MATCH (add "Full Stack Experience")
- Profile is Software Engineer (general), JD is Frontend-specific → NO MATCH (add "Frontend Specialist")

- **If titles MATCH:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | [Key Tech 1] | [Key Tech 2] | [Key Tech 3] | [Key Tech 4] (NO specialization added)
- **If titles DON'T match:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | [JD-Related Specialization] | [Key Tech 1] | [Key Tech 2] | [Key Tech 3] | [Key Tech 4]

- **JD-Related Specialization (ONLY if titles don't match):** Add 1 specialization/role that aligns with the JD focus (e.g., if applying for frontend job with full stack profile: "Frontend Specialist" or "Frontend Lead")
  - If JD is frontend-focused → "Frontend Specialist" or "Frontend Lead"
  - If JD is backend-focused → "Backend Specialist" or "Backend Architect"
  - If JD is Full Stack-focused → "Full Stack Developer" or "Full Stack Experience"
  - If JD is DevOps-focused → "DevOps Specialist" or "Infrastructure Lead"
  - If JD is QA-focused → "QA Specialist" or "Quality Assurance Lead"
  - Match the specialization to the JD's primary focus area

- **Tech Stack:** Extract 4-6 most important technologies/tech stack items from JD (prioritize: frameworks, tools, platforms, methodologies)
- Separate all items with " | " (space-pipe-space)

- **Examples:**
  - Profile: "Senior Full Stack Engineer", JD: "Full Stack Developer" → MATCH → "Senior Full Stack Engineer | React | TypeScript | Next.js | AWS" (NO specialization)
  - Profile: "Full Stack Software Engineer", JD: "Full Stack Developer" → MATCH → "Full Stack Software Engineer | Java | Python | React.js | GCP" (NO specialization)
  - Profile: "Senior Frontend Software Engineer", JD: "Frontend Developer" → MATCH → "Senior Frontend Software Engineer | React | TypeScript | Next.js | AWS" (NO specialization)
  - Profile: "Senior Full Stack Engineer", JD: "Frontend Engineer" → NO MATCH → "Senior Full Stack Engineer | Frontend Specialist | React.js | TypeScript | Next.js | AWS"
  - Profile: "Senior Software Engineer", JD: "Backend Engineer" → NO MATCH → "Senior Software Engineer | Backend Architect | Node.js | Python | Microservices | Docker"
  - Profile: "Senior Frontend Engineer", JD: "Full Stack Developer" → NO MATCH → "Senior Frontend Engineer | Full Stack Experience | React.js | Node.js | PostgreSQL | AWS"

**3. SUMMARY** (5-6 lines, 8-12 JD keywords + 3-5 domain): Line 1: [Title] with {{yearsOfExperience}}+ years in [domain]. Line 2: Expertise in [domain keyword] + [3-4 JD techs with versions]. Line 3: Track record in [domain keyword] + [achievement with metric]. Line 4: Proficient in [3-4 more JD techs]. Line 5: [Soft skill] professional with Agile/leadership experience. Line 6: Focus on [2-3 JD skill areas] + scalable solutions.

---

**4. SKILLS** (60-80 total, 5-8 categories): Categories by JD focus (Frontend, Backend, Cloud, DevOps, Security). 8-12 skills/category. Capitalize first letter. NO version spam. Group cloud: "AWS (Lambda, S3, EC2)". 70% JD keywords + 30% complementary. Domain category if relevant (FinTech→"Payment & Compliance", Healthcare→"Healthcare Compliance", Security→"Security & Identity", Data→"Data Governance").

---

**5. EXPERIENCE** ({{experienceCount}} entries, 6-8 bullets each): The **JOB DESCRIPTION IS PRIMARY**. Every bullet must be mapped to 1-3 high-priority JD requirements while still accurately reflecting the candidate's real work history. 6-8 bullets/job (recent=8, older=5-6). 25-35 words/bullet. 2-4 exact JD keywords/bullet. EVERY bullet needs a metric (%, $, time, scale, users). Industry context in 2-3 bullets/job. Overall targeting **ATS score ≥ 95%**.

**CRITICAL: JD-FIRST, DETAIL-BASED BULLETS (TARGET ATS ≥ 95%)** - ALWAYS treat the JD as the primary source for what to highlight, but the candidate's experience details as the source of truth:
1. **Start from provided Details** - For any job that includes "Details", you MUST derive bullets from those actual accomplishments and responsibilities (do not invent unrelated work).
2. **Align to JD for ATS** - Enhance and tailor each bullet by adding JD-relevant keywords, mapping to JD responsibilities, and ensuring strong metrics, with the explicit goal of achieving **ATS ≥ 95%**.
3. **Maintain authenticity** - Keep the core accomplishments, seniority level, and technologies from the provided details; only refine wording, structure, and keyword usage for ATS optimization.
4. **If no details provided** - Then (and only then) generate bullets based on the job title, company, dates, and JD requirements, ensuring JD alignment and ATS ≥ 95% while staying plausible for that role.

**CRITICAL: TECHNOLOGY RELEASE DATES** - You MUST verify that every technology/framework/tool mentioned in experience bullets was actually available/released during that job's time period. Check the job dates (start_date - end_date) and ONLY use technologies that existed at that time. Examples:
- Angular: Released 2016 → CANNOT use for jobs before 2016
- React: Released 2013 → CANNOT use for jobs before 2013
- TypeScript: Released 2012 → CANNOT use for jobs before 2012
- Vue.js: Released 2014 → CANNOT use for jobs before 2014
- Next.js: Released 2016 → CANNOT use for jobs before 2016
- Docker: Released 2013 → CANNOT use for jobs before 2013
- Kubernetes: Released 2014 → CANNOT use for jobs before 2014
- AWS Lambda: Released 2014 → CANNOT use for jobs before 2014
- GraphQL: Released 2015 → CANNOT use for jobs before 2015
- If unsure about a technology's release date, use generic terms or older alternatives that existed at that time (e.g., for pre-2013 frontend: jQuery, Backbone.js, AngularJS 1.x; for pre-2013 backend: PHP, Java, .NET, Ruby on Rails).

**Bullet:** [Action Verb] + [JD Tech that existed during job period] + [built] + [impact] + [metric]. Verbs: Architected, Engineered, Designed, Built, Developed, Implemented, Optimized, Enhanced, Led, Spearheaded, Automated, Deployed. AVOID: "Responsible for", "Worked on".

**Metrics:** Performance (40% faster, 3x throughput), Scale (50K+ users, 10M+ records), Cost (saved $500K, reduced costs 35%), Time (deployment 2hrs→15min), Quality (99.9% uptime, 90% coverage), Team (led team of 10).

---

**ATS CHECKLIST:** Use EXACT JD phrases (not synonyms). High-priority keywords 3-4x (Skills+Summary+2-3 bullets). All required/preferred JD skills in Skills. Match tech versions. Natural flow, professional tone, varied verbs, strong metrics, domain keywords integrated.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:**
You MUST return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks, no text before or after the JSON.

The JSON structure must be exactly:
{
  "title": "Job Title | Tech1 | Tech2 | Tech3 | Tech4",
  "summary": "5-6 line summary paragraph",
  "skills": {
    "Category1": ["Skill1", "Skill2", "Skill3"],
    "Category2": ["Skill4", "Skill5", "Skill6"]
  },
  "experience": [
    {
      "title": "Job Title",
      "details": [
        "Bullet point 1 with metric",
        "Bullet point 2 with metric",
        "Bullet point 3 with metric"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

**REMEMBER:** Return ONLY the JSON object. Start with { and end with }. No markdown code blocks, no explanations, no other text.
