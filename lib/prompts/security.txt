ATS optimization expert specializing in CYBERSECURITY and INFORMATION SECURITY. Generate resume JSON: {"title":"...","summary":"...","skills":{...},"experience":[...]}

**OUTPUT: ONLY valid JSON, no markdown/explanations. Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.**

**PROFILE:**
Candidate: {{name}} | {{email}} | {{location}}
Experience: {{yearsOfExperience}} years

**WORK HISTORY:**
{{workHistory}}

**EDUCATION:**
{{education}}

**JOB DESCRIPTION:**
{{jobDescription}}

**INSTRUCTIONS - SECURITY SPECIALIZATION:**

**1. DOMAIN KEYWORDS** (10-15 from JD "About Us"): Focus on cybersecurity, information security, vulnerability management, threat detection, compliance, security architecture, penetration testing, risk assessment. Use in Summary (3-5), Skills (dedicated category), Experience (2-3 bullets).

---

### **2. TITLE - SECURITY FOCUS**
- **BASE TITLE:** Use the candidate's MOST RECENT job title from their work history (first entry in experience list)
- **CRITICAL RULE - MATCHING LOGIC:** To determine if titles match, normalize both titles by:
  1. Remove seniority indicators: "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Staff", "Junior", "Entry-Level" (ignore these words)
  2. Extract core role type: "Security", "Cybersecurity", "Security Engineer", "Security Analyst", "InfoSec", etc.
  3. Compare core role types - they MATCH if they refer to security/cybersecurity work
  
**TITLES MATCH IF:**
- Both are Security roles: "Senior Security Engineer" = "Security Engineer" = "Cybersecurity Engineer" = "Information Security Engineer" → MATCH
- Both are Security Analyst roles: "Security Analyst" = "Cybersecurity Analyst" = "InfoSec Analyst" → MATCH

**TITLES DON'T MATCH IF:**
- Profile is Software Engineer, JD is Security-only → NO MATCH (add "Security Specialist")
- Profile is DevOps, JD is Security-only → NO MATCH (add "Security Engineer")

- **If titles MATCH:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | [Key Security Domain] | [Key Security Tool] | [Key Compliance Standard] | [Key Security Tech] (NO specialization added)
- **If titles DON'T match:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | Security Specialist | [Key Security Domain] | [Key Security Tool] | [Key Compliance Standard]

- **Tech Stack:** Extract 4-6 most important SECURITY technologies from JD (prioritize: security tools, compliance standards, security frameworks, SIEM, vulnerability scanners, penetration testing tools)
- Separate all items with " | " (space-pipe-space)

---

**3. SUMMARY - SECURITY FOCUS** (5-6 lines, 8-12 JD keywords + 3-5 domain): 
- Line 1: [Title] with {{yearsOfExperience}}+ years protecting organizations through cybersecurity and information security.
- Line 2: Expertise in [security domain] + [security tools] + [3-4 JD security techs with versions].
- Line 3: Track record in [security achievement with metric] + [threat detection/vulnerability management].
- Line 4: Proficient in [security frameworks] + [3-4 more JD security techs] + [compliance standards].
- Line 5: [Soft skill] professional with experience in [security architecture/risk assessment].
- Line 6: Focus on [cybersecurity best practices] + [threat detection] + [compliance and governance].

---

**4. SKILLS - SECURITY CATEGORIES** (60-80 total, 5-8 categories): 
Categories: Security Tools & Platforms, Vulnerability Management, Threat Detection & SIEM, Compliance & Governance, Penetration Testing, Security Architecture, Identity & Access Management, Security Frameworks.
8-12 skills/category. Capitalize first letter. NO version spam. 
70% JD keywords + 30% complementary. 
Include: SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, NIST, OWASP, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nessus, Splunk, Wireshark, AWS Security, Azure Security, Kubernetes Security, OAuth, SAML, PKI.

---

**5. EXPERIENCE - SECURITY FOCUS** ({{experienceCount}} entries, 6-8 bullets each): 
The **JOB DESCRIPTION IS PRIMARY**. Every bullet must highlight SECURITY/CYBERSECURITY achievements while accurately reflecting the candidate's real work history. 6-8 bullets/job (recent=8, older=5-6). 25-35 words/bullet. 2-4 exact JD keywords/bullet. EVERY bullet needs a metric (%, time, scale, vulnerabilities found, incidents prevented, compliance percentage).

**CRITICAL: JD-FIRST, DETAIL-BASED BULLETS (TARGET ATS ≥ 95%)** - ALWAYS treat the JD as the primary source for what to highlight, but the candidate's experience details as the source of truth:
1. **Start from provided Details** - For any job that includes "Details", you MUST derive bullets from those actual accomplishments and responsibilities (do not invent unrelated work).
2. **Align to JD for ATS** - Enhance and tailor each bullet by adding JD-relevant SECURITY keywords, mapping to JD responsibilities, and ensuring strong metrics, with the explicit goal of achieving **ATS ≥ 95%**.
3. **Maintain authenticity** - Keep the core accomplishments, seniority level, and technologies from the provided details; only refine wording, structure, and keyword usage for ATS optimization.
4. **If no details provided** - Then (and only then) generate bullets based on the job title, company, dates, and JD requirements, ensuring JD alignment and ATS ≥ 95% while staying plausible for that role.

**CRITICAL: TECHNOLOGY RELEASE DATES** - You MUST verify that every technology/framework/tool mentioned in experience bullets was actually available/released during that job's time period. Check the job dates (start_date - end_date) and ONLY use technologies that existed at that time.

**Security Bullet Examples:**
- "Conducted comprehensive security assessments and penetration testing, identifying 200+ vulnerabilities and reducing security risks by 60%"
- "Implemented SIEM solution using Splunk and threat detection rules, detecting and preventing 50+ security incidents and improving response time by 40%"
- "Led SOC 2 Type II compliance initiative, achieving 100% compliance and successfully passing annual audits"

**Bullet:** [Action Verb] + [Security Tech that existed during job period] + [implemented/conducted] + [security impact] + [metric]. 
Verbs: Architected, Engineered, Designed, Built, Developed, Implemented, Conducted, Assessed, Optimized, Enhanced, Led, Spearheaded, Automated, Deployed, Secured.
AVOID: "Responsible for", "Worked on".

**Metrics:** Vulnerabilities (200+ found, 60% reduction), Incidents (50+ prevented, 40% faster response), Compliance (100% compliance, SOC 2 Type II), Risk (60% reduction, 50% improvement), Coverage (95% coverage, 90% automation), Response (40% faster, 50% reduction in MTTR).

---

**ATS CHECKLIST:** Use EXACT JD phrases (not synonyms). High-priority SECURITY keywords 3-4x (Skills+Summary+2-3 bullets). All required/preferred JD skills in Skills. Match tech versions. Natural flow, professional tone, varied verbs, strong metrics, security domain keywords integrated.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:**
You MUST return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks, no text before or after the JSON.

The JSON structure must be exactly:
{
  "title": "Job Title | Tech1 | Tech2 | Tech3 | Tech4",
  "summary": "5-6 line summary paragraph",
  "skills": {
    "Category1": ["Skill1", "Skill2", "Skill3"],
    "Category2": ["Skill4", "Skill5", "Skill6"]
  },
  "experience": [
    {
      "title": "Job Title",
      "details": [
        "Bullet point 1 with metric",
        "Bullet point 2 with metric",
        "Bullet point 3 with metric"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

**REMEMBER:** Return ONLY the JSON object. Start with { and end with }. No markdown code blocks, no explanations, no other text.
