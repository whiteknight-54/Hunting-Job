ATS optimization expert specializing in PRODUCT MANAGEMENT. Generate resume JSON: {"title":"...","summary":"...","skills":{...},"experience":[...]}

**OUTPUT: ONLY valid JSON, no markdown/explanations. Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.**

**PROFILE:**
Candidate: {{name}} | {{email}} | {{location}}
Experience: {{yearsOfExperience}} years

**WORK HISTORY:**
{{workHistory}}

**EDUCATION:**
{{education}}

**JOB DESCRIPTION:**
{{jobDescription}}

**INSTRUCTIONS - PRODUCT MANAGEMENT SPECIALIZATION:**

**1. DOMAIN KEYWORDS** (10-15 from JD "About Us"): Focus on product strategy, roadmap, stakeholder management, user research, market analysis, product metrics, agile/scrum, go-to-market. Use in Summary (3-5), Skills (dedicated category), Experience (2-3 bullets).

---

### **2. TITLE - PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FOCUS**
- **BASE TITLE:** Use the candidate's MOST RECENT job title from their work history (first entry in experience list)
- **CRITICAL RULE - MATCHING LOGIC:** To determine if titles match, normalize both titles by:
  1. Remove seniority indicators: "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Staff", "Junior", "Entry-Level" (ignore these words)
  2. Extract core role type: "Product Manager", "PM", "Product Owner", "PO", "Product Lead", etc.
  3. Compare core role types - they MATCH if they refer to product management work
  
**TITLES MATCH IF:**
- Both are Product Manager roles: "Senior Product Manager" = "Product Manager" = "Product Lead" = "Product Owner" → MATCH
- Both are PM roles: "PM" = "Product Manager" = "Technical Product Manager" → MATCH

**TITLES DON'T MATCH IF:**
- Profile is Software Engineer, JD is Product Manager → NO MATCH (add "Product Management Experience")
- Profile is Business Analyst, JD is Product Manager → NO MATCH (add "Product Manager")

- **If titles MATCH:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | [Product Domain] | [Key Product Tool] | [Key Methodology] | [Key Product Area] (NO specialization added)
- **If titles DON'T match:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | Product Management Experience | [Product Domain] | [Key Product Tool] | [Key Methodology]

- **Tech Stack:** Extract 4-6 most important PRODUCT MANAGEMENT tools/domains from JD (prioritize: product domains, analytics tools, collaboration tools, agile/scrum, product metrics)
- Separate all items with " | " (space-pipe-space)

---

**3. SUMMARY - PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FOCUS** (5-6 lines, 8-12 JD keywords + 3-5 domain): 
- Line 1: [Title] with {{yearsOfExperience}}+ years driving product strategy and delivering successful products.
- Line 2: Expertise in [product domain] + [product management methodologies] + [3-4 JD product tools/domains].
- Line 3: Track record in [product achievement with metric] + [user growth/revenue impact].
- Line 4: Proficient in [product analytics] + [3-4 more JD product tools] + [stakeholder management].

---

**5. EXPERIENCE - PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FOCUS** ({{experienceCount}} entries, 6-8 bullets each): 
The **JOB DESCRIPTION IS PRIMARY**. Every bullet must highlight PRODUCT MANAGEMENT achievements while accurately reflecting the candidate's real work history. 6-8 bullets/job (recent=8, older=5-6). 25-35 words/bullet. 2-4 exact JD keywords/bullet. EVERY bullet needs a metric (%, $, time, scale, users, revenue, growth, engagement).

**CRITICAL: JD-FIRST, DETAIL-BASED BULLETS (TARGET ATS ≥ 95%)** - ALWAYS treat the JD as the primary source for what to highlight, but the candidate's experience details as the source of truth:
1. **Start from provided Details** - For any job that includes "Details", you MUST derive bullets from those actual accomplishments and responsibilities (do not invent unrelated work).
2. **Align to JD for ATS** - Enhance and tailor each bullet by adding JD-relevant PRODUCT MANAGEMENT keywords, mapping to JD responsibilities, and ensuring strong metrics, with the explicit goal of achieving **ATS ≥ 95%**.
3. **Maintain authenticity** - Keep the core accomplishments, seniority level, and technologies from the provided details; only refine wording, structure, and keyword usage for ATS optimization.
4. **If no details provided** - Then (and only then) generate bullets based on the job title, company, dates, and JD requirements, ensuring JD alignment and ATS ≥ 95% while staying plausible for that role.

**CRITICAL: TECHNOLOGY RELEASE DATES** - You MUST verify that every technology/framework/tool mentioned in experience bullets was actually available/released during that job's time period. Check the job dates (start_date - end_date) and ONLY use technologies that existed at that time.

**Product Manager Bullet Examples:**
- "Led product strategy and roadmap for mobile application, increasing user base by 200% and generating $5M in annual revenue"
- "Managed cross-functional product team using Agile/Scrum, delivering 15+ product features and improving user engagement by 40%"
- "Conducted user research and data analysis to inform product decisions, resulting in 30% increase in conversion rate and 25% improvement in user satisfaction"

**Bullet:** [Action Verb] + [Product Management Activity] + [product/feature impact] + [metric]. 
Verbs: Led, Managed, Drove, Developed, Launched, Executed, Delivered, Optimized, Enhanced, Spearheaded, Coordinated, Collaborated, Analyzed, Researched.
AVOID: "Responsible for", "Worked on".

**Metrics:** Growth (200% increase, 30% growth), Revenue ($5M revenue, 25% increase), Engagement (40% improvement, 30% increase), Users (200K+ users, 50% growth), Features (15+ features, 20+ releases), Satisfaction (25% improvement, 90% satisfaction), Conversion (30% increase, 50% improvement).

---

**ATS CHECKLIST:** Use EXACT JD phrases (not synonyms). High-priority PRODUCT MANAGEMENT keywords 3-4x (Skills+Summary+2-3 bullets). All required/preferred JD skills in Skills. Match tech versions. Natural flow, professional tone, varied verbs, strong metrics, product management domain keywords integrated.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:**
