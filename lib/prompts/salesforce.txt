ATS optimization expert specializing in SALESFORCE/CRM development and administration. Generate resume JSON: {"title":"...","summary":"...","skills":{...},"experience":[...]}

**OUTPUT: ONLY valid JSON, no markdown/explanations. Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.**

**PROFILE:**
Candidate: {{name}} | {{email}} | {{location}}
Experience: {{yearsOfExperience}} years

**WORK HISTORY:**
{{workHistory}}

**EDUCATION:**
{{education}}

**JOB DESCRIPTION:**
{{jobDescription}}

**INSTRUCTIONS - SALESFORCE/CRM SPECIALIZATION:**

**1. DOMAIN KEYWORDS** (10-15 from JD "About Us"): Focus on CRM, customer relationship management, sales automation, service cloud, marketing automation, platform customization, enterprise solutions. Use in Summary (3-5), Skills (dedicated category), Experience (2-3 bullets).

---

### **2. TITLE - SALESFORCE FOCUS**
- **BASE TITLE:** Use the candidate's MOST RECENT job title from their work history (first entry in experience list)
- **CRITICAL RULE - MATCHING LOGIC:** To determine if titles match, normalize both titles by:
  1. Remove seniority indicators: "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Staff", "Junior", "Entry-Level" (ignore these words)
  2. Extract core role type: "Salesforce", "CRM", "Salesforce Developer", "Salesforce Admin", "Salesforce Consultant", etc.
  3. Compare core role types - they MATCH if they refer to Salesforce/CRM work
  
**TITLES MATCH IF:**
- Both are Salesforce roles: "Senior Salesforce Developer" = "Salesforce Developer" = "Salesforce Engineer" = "SFDC Developer" → MATCH
- Both are CRM roles: "CRM Developer" = "Salesforce Consultant" = "CRM Architect" → MATCH

**TITLES DON'T MATCH IF:**
- Profile is Software Engineer, JD is Salesforce-only → NO MATCH (add "Salesforce Specialist")
- Profile is Backend, JD is Salesforce-only → NO MATCH (add "Salesforce Developer")

- **If titles MATCH:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | [Salesforce Cloud] | [Key Salesforce Tech 1] | [Key Salesforce Tech 2] | [Key Integration Tech] (NO specialization added)
- **If titles DON'T match:** Use format: [Profile's Most Recent Title] | Salesforce Specialist | [Salesforce Cloud] | [Key Salesforce Tech 1] | [Key Salesforce Tech 2]

- **Tech Stack:** Extract 4-6 most important SALESFORCE technologies from JD (prioritize: Salesforce Clouds, Apex, Lightning, Visualforce, LWC, Flows, Integrations, CPQ, Commerce Cloud)
- Separate all items with " | " (space-pipe-space)

---

**3. SUMMARY - SALESFORCE FOCUS** (5-6 lines, 8-12 JD keywords + 3-5 domain): 
- Line 1: [Title] with {{yearsOfExperience}}+ years building and customizing Salesforce CRM solutions.
- Line 2: Expertise in [Salesforce Cloud] + [Apex/Lightning] + [3-4 JD Salesforce techs with versions].
- Line 3: Track record in [Salesforce implementation/customization with metric] + [business process automation].
- Line 4: Proficient in [Salesforce platform features] + [3-4 more JD Salesforce techs] + [integrations].
- Line 5: [Soft skill] professional with experience in [Salesforce administration/consulting].
- Line 6: Focus on [Salesforce best practices] + [scalable CRM solutions] + [user adoption optimization].

Categories: Salesforce Platform, Development & Customization, Salesforce Clouds, Integration & APIs, Data Management, Administration & Configuration, Certifications, Related Technologies.
8-12 skills/category. Capitalize first letter. NO version spam.

---

**5. EXPERIENCE - SALESFORCE FOCUS** ({{experienceCount}} entries, 6-8 bullets each): 
The **JOB DESCRIPTION IS PRIMARY**. Every bullet must highlight SALESFORCE/CRM achievements while accurately reflecting the candidate's real work history. 6-8 bullets/job (recent=8, older=5-6). 25-35 words/bullet. 2-4 exact JD keywords/bullet. EVERY bullet needs a metric (%, $, time, scale, users, records, automation efficiency).

**CRITICAL: JD-FIRST, DETAIL-BASED BULLETS (TARGET ATS ≥ 95%)** - ALWAYS treat the JD as the primary source for what to highlight, but the candidate's experience details as the source of truth:
1. **Start from provided Details** - For any job that includes "Details", you MUST derive bullets from those actual accomplishments and responsibilities (do not invent unrelated work).
2. **Align to JD for ATS** - Enhance and tailor each bullet by adding JD-relevant SALESFORCE keywords, mapping to JD responsibilities, and ensuring strong metrics, with the explicit goal of achieving **ATS ≥ 95%**.
3. **Maintain authenticity** - Keep the core accomplishments, seniority level, and technologies from the provided details; only refine wording, structure, and keyword usage for ATS optimization.
4. **If no details provided** - Then (and only then) generate bullets based on the job title, company, dates, and JD requirements, ensuring JD alignment and ATS ≥ 95% while staying plausible for that role.

**CRITICAL: TECHNOLOGY RELEASE DATES** - You MUST verify that every technology/framework/tool mentioned in experience bullets was actually available/released during that job's time period. Check the job dates (start_date - end_date) and ONLY use technologies that existed at that time.

**Salesforce Bullet Examples:**
- "Developed and deployed custom Lightning Web Components (LWC) and Apex classes, automating sales processes for 500+ users and reducing manual data entry by 60%"
- "Architected Salesforce Service Cloud implementation with custom workflows and Flows, improving case resolution time by 40% and increasing customer satisfaction by 25%"
- "Built Salesforce CPQ solution with complex pricing rules and product configuration, processing $50M+ in annual revenue and reducing quote generation time from 2 days to 2 hours"

**Bullet:** [Action Verb] + [Salesforce Tech that existed during job period] + [built/configured] + [CRM/business impact] + [metric]. 
Verbs: Architected, Engineered, Designed, Built, Developed, Implemented, Configured, Customized, Optimized, Enhanced, Led, Spearheaded, Automated, Deployed, Migrated.
AVOID: "Responsible for", "Worked on".

**Metrics:** Performance (40% faster, 60% reduction), Scale (500+ users, $50M+ revenue, 1M+ records), Time (2 days→2 hours, 40% faster), Efficiency (60% automation, 50% reduction in manual work), Adoption (95% user adoption, 25% increase), Quality (99.9% uptime, 90% satisfaction).

---

**ATS CHECKLIST:** Use EXACT JD phrases (not synonyms). High-priority SALESFORCE keywords 3-4x (Skills+Summary+2-3 bullets). All required/preferred JD skills in Skills. Match tech versions. Natural flow, professional tone, varied verbs, strong metrics, Salesforce domain keywords integrated.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:**
You MUST return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks, no text before or after the JSON.

The JSON structure must be exactly:
{
  "title": "Job Title | Tech1 | Tech2 | Tech3 | Tech4",
  "summary": "5-6 line summary paragraph",
  "skills": {
    "Category1": ["Skill1", "Skill2", "Skill3"],
    "Category2": ["Skill4", "Skill5", "Skill6"]
  },
  "experience": [
    {
      "title": "Job Title",
      "details": [
        "Bullet point 1 with metric",
        "Bullet point 2 with metric",
        "Bullet point 3 with metric"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

**REMEMBER:** Return ONLY the JSON object. Start with { and end with }. No markdown code blocks, no explanations, no other text.
